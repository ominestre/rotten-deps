## v1.0.1

### Dependencies

- Updated several dev dependencies which finally clears up the `eslint-plugin-import` vulnerabilities failing the audit pipeline
- Updated `yargs` 17.4.0 -> 17.4.1
  - This addresses several bugs that I don't believe have an impact on this project

## v1.0.0

ðŸŽ‰ With the hem and haw of the CHANGELOG all of the previous betas weren't done in a way to nicely rollup for the v1.0.0 release notes. So instead here is a nice list of the features I'm launching this with:

### API

- Everything is organized so that you can directly import `rotten-deps` and use it for programmatic report generation. You can also import the individual libraries for processing config and interacting with NPM but this isn't officially supported at this moment.

### CLI

- You can set a default expiration via the CLI flag `--default-expiration`
- You can output raw JSON instead of a table using the `--json` flag
- By default you get a nice table display

### Exit codes for CI

As mentioned in the main `README.md` the project uses exit codes to differentiate between a success (no outdated), a warn (some outdated but within compliance windows), and a fail (something is outdated beyond compliance window).

### Configuration

- You can flat out ignore a dependency from the check using the `ignore` property of a rule
- You can give a dependency it's own compliance window separate from  the default expiration
- You can provide a reason for the whitelist to help you remember why you whitelisted it in the first place (e.g. Depends on Bootstrap v1.2.3 upgrade)

## v1.0.0-beta.26

### Enhancement

- Enables using `--default-expiration` CLI flag alongside a config file. In the case of it being specified in both locations the CLI flag value takes precedence. [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/83)
- Adds `reason` property to the rules for making notes on why you whitelisted a dependency [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/84)

### Documentation

- Replaces unmaintained typedoc pages plugin [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/82)
- Revises the release and config docs. The config docs were missing a property and the formatting was changed for better readability at a glance. [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/80)

### Chores

- Replaces `cli-table` with `cli-table3` since the former is no longer maintained

## 1.0.0-beta.25

### Enhancements

- Adds "days allowed" to the report generator and CLI table which represents either the default config or one for the specific rule. This is to help visualize how a dependency was determined to be outdated. [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/78)
- Refactored the report generator so that the requests for package details are now done in parallel instead of sequentially [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/64)
- Upgraded to Yargs `v17.x` which drops support for Node `v10.x`. Node `v10.x` will no longer be tested
and supported by this project [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/55)

### Fixes

- Fixed days outdated being calculated incorrectly [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/61)

### Chores

- Patches Lodash to address command injection in Lodash templates [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/55)
- Patches developer dependencies [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/55)
- Patches many many more dependencies after a hiatus from the project (didn't keep track of all the PRs)
- Added testing support for Node 16.x
- Dropped support for Node 10.x

### Documentation

- Added docs on contributing to the project [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/58/)
- Added docs on how the days outdated are determined [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/61)
- Changed the format of `CHANGELOG.md` again [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/58/)
- Fixed typos and linting issues in all of the projects documentation [change](https://github.com/ominestre/rotten-deps/pull/75)
