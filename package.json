  "description": "The command `npm outdated` only has two endpoints which are pass or fail. This dichotomy isn't very useful for CI flows which have pass, fail, or warn. This CLI utility combines `npm outdated` and `npm view` in order to establish a compliance period for dependency checks. This way if a dependency update is within your compliance period you can trigger a warn or if it's beyond your compliance period it can trigger a fail.",
