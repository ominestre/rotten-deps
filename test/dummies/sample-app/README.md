# Sample App

This is setup to intentionally have out of date dependencies for testing purposes. Feel free to add to it.
My methods were to use `npm view express time` to get just the timestamps of publish dates and then
`npm i --save express@x.x.x`.

Left-pad was good to use because it's unlikely to update so I could test a version not far behind current.
